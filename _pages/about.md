Hello, my name is Jaebin (Denny) Cheong. I am a Masters student, specializing in Data Science in the Department of Statistics and Data Science, at Yonsei University. I am currently attending my first semester and I originally created this github to detail my journey as a graduate student!

I'm currently interested in the field of **representational learning**, particularly **self-supervised learning**. I'm also interested in **causal representation learning**, **unlearning**, and **efficient ML**. As AI and data science continue to expand, my interests do as well. Expect periodic updates as new research directions emerge.

### More about Me:

I was born in Seoul, South Korea, but due to my dad's occupation, I have had the opportunity to live in the US, Brazil and in Poland, which gave me the opportunity to immerse myself in those rich yet unique cultures. ## Update this later!
