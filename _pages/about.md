Hello, my name is Jaebin (Denny) Cheong. I am a masters student, specializing in Data Science in the Department of Statistics and Data Science, at Yonsei University. I am currently attending my first semester and I originally created this github to detail my journey as a graduate student! 

This is only just the beginning!
